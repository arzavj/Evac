Hi <%=askName%>,

<%url = "http://vidactica.com"%>
YOU have confirmed the following time to vidact about “<%= @question.question %>:”
<br /><br /> 
<%= @appointment.appointment.localtime.strftime("%A %B %d %I:%M %p %Z")%> 
<br />
<b>Please be on time</b>
<br /><br /> 
You will be able to enter the chatroom through your <a href="<%=url+"/conversations"%>">‘My Conversations’</a> tab 5 minutes before the scheduled time.
<br /><br /> 
If you can no longer make this scheduled time, please make sure to propose an alternate time as soon as possible so your fellow Vidactica user is made aware of your absence and not kept waiting in the chat-room. 
<br /><br />
Have fun!
